# pi-breathe

pi-breathe is a set of tools that tell you the best route to go from one place
to another while avoiding pollution. It does this by collecting pollution data
from its users who wear a 'client'.

# TODO / alternative functionality
* Take into account the speed to calculate the pollution source
* Install a GPS on the raspberry pi
* Open sqlite3 database more globally in api.py instead of opening it at each
  request
